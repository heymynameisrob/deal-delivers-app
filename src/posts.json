Sarah’s pampering products and home ‘treat’ment kits helped kept us sane(ish!) during lockdown and she has rave 5* reviews on Facebook.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dealdelivers/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_80,w_500/v1603123131/daisy-green_nhxata.jpg \"Sarah Jane and her handmade organic lavender and raw coconut oil salt scrub\")\n\nSarah is a holistic therapist, born and bred in Deal. She is married with two children, one aged 22 living independently and a 17 year old still at home busy studying for A levels - oh, and tortoise Terence Trent (after singer D’Arby, cross our hearts).\n\n> I have always loved beauty products and when I first went for a spa day I decided it was the career for me! When my son was two, I enrolled in adult education and qualified as a beauty therapist and compelted a holistc massage course followed by various jobs in spas and salons including spa manager for a leading skincare bran. I took the plunge to set up on my own three years ago. I invested in a rather wonderful shed in my garden, my natural skincare studio, where I like to treat people’s skin beautifully, help their aches and pains, give my clients a moment in their packed lives for some hard-earned ‘me-time’ to think about nothing and even nap away from their kids and job. In the sanctuary of the shed, I offer bespoke holistic facials, hot stone massage, head massage, body scrubs, waxing, manicures, pedicures and pregnancy treatments. I love talking to people to really get what makes them tick, what they need so I can best help them. I also offer a bespoke organic product range from Surrey starting at £15 and make my own lavender body scrubs. Our pamper baskets from £20 are ready for gifting anytime, especially at Christmas and individual products will be ethically wrapped in scarves made out of recycled saris I select from another local independent.\n>\n> During lockdown, I had to shut my spa business which was utterly heart-breaking. I’m not afraid to say I’m an emotional person, so many tears were shed. My pampering products were all sitting in the spa, so I decided to make up face and body pamper packs and deliver them to my customers at home… literally on my bike!\n>\n> I contacted all my customers to tell them I had to close and offering them our product packs. I was so relieved when they loved the idea: deliveries kept my mind and brain ticking over, my body out in the fresh air with spa deliveries in my ‘granny-style’ bike basket! Most of my orders came via the Deal Delivers facebook page, which accounted for about 60% of the business - a total lifeline for me to pay the bills. People wanted to treat themselves, and get back to a bit of normality when times were anything but normal. Treat night in like mum and daughter pedis were particularly popular.\n>\n> Now government guidelines have changed, thankfully I am back open. Our ‘one in one out’ is easier to control in my shed spa than a salon. Deliveries have reduced but we are making up special Christmas hampers and seeing gift vouchers rising as more people have heard about us and Christmas creeps up!\n\n### **Favourite Things**\n\n#### 1. The beach\n\nI know it’s a bit of a cliché, but the beach is where I’m happy and is at the centre of many of my fond memories growing up here in Deal. A walk along the sea front is where I go for time to myself, to get some fresh air and clear my thoughts, although I have never seen the beach so busy as this year! I always notice if you are in the car coming from London, as you get towards Dover the air quality changes. I like to go early, about 6am and usually stroll between Deal and Sandown Castle. Some days the sea is tranquil, other days its crazy and I often see the ‘Deal seal’. Can anyone tell me if there’s more than one?\n\n#### 2. Deal People\n\nThere is so much community spirit here in Deal, in a crisis like we have just had, it is heartening to see everyone rallying together to help each other out and get through together. Deal has history, charm, character and smiley people- no wonder we are becoming ever more popular.\n\n#### 3. Kingsdown Woods\n\nWith the seafront one side, in just a couple of minutes’ walk you can be in the woods, through the fields or along the cliffs exploring all the wonderful nature of the area, butterflies, bees, flowers…\n\nI particularly love seeing and smelling the carpet of bluebells in Kingsdown Woods in the spring and snowdrops in the winter.\n\n#### 4. St Margaret’s and Sandwich Bays\n\nA walk along the cliffs to the cosy beach at St Margaret’s is lovely, with a bonus it’s not so well known, so less busy or crowded. You can have a well-earned drink at **[The Coastguard](https://thecoastguard.co.uk/)** and I sometimes walk on to Dover.\n\nSandwich Bay is beautiful, we sometimes take our campervan during the day and make our lunch in our little kitchen, maybe a nice chicken salad with meat, breads and dips from **[Deal’s wonderful Saturday market](https://www.facebook.com/DealTownMarket)**. I particularly appreciate the greengrocers and good quality meat from the butcher there. I’d also recommend a day trip to Rye, especially the nature reserve where we saw a family of seals recently.\n\n#### 5. Top restaurants\n\n**[The Thai Restaurant](https://www.bangkokpavilion.co.uk/)** on High Street and [Beach Street Table 81](https://81beachstreet.co.uk/) are our favourites so far. Located opposite The Royal Hotel, I think 81’s burgers and sea bass are particularly good, really lovely food. Two years ago, I travelled Thailand for four weeks and fell in love with the spiciness of Thai food. A Pad Thai or Red Thai curry with Udon noodles on the High Street brings those magical memories back…\n\n#### 6. Urban Chic\n\nThe owners at [Urban Chic](http://www.urbanchicltd.co.uk/), Claire and Dawn are so friendly. I love their clothes, my most recent purchase being a T Shirt and I can always find little gifts for people.\n\n#### \\\n7. Local food\n\n[Jill Martin of Town Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/jill.martin.1460) has a stall at the Saturday Market where I am always tempted by her delicious sausage rolls and curries. I was also introduced to the scrummy [Hotsie Totsie cakes](https://www.facebook.com/hotsytotsycb) and bakes by Jill’s daughter Jessica Martin through the Deal Delivers page and have become a regular customer. Can I recommend her gin and tonic cake? Mmmm. I went to a ‘Ladies at Lunch’ event recently where Jill was the guest speaker and her daughter Jessica made the delicious dessert. To attend the event advertised online, you have to get in quick for the few spaces round Jill’s kitchen table… which is also in her garden shed. There’s clearly a theme!\n\n##### You can book spa treatments, vouchers or products with Sarah on [Daisy45green at gmail dot com](mailto:Daisy45green@gmail.com) or call 07504 023086"},{"id":"my-first-post-yo","title":"My First Post, Yo!","cover":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/2365457/pexels-photo-2365457.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=750&w=1260","date":"December 11, 2019","content":"\nWelcome to My Blog. *It's a beautiful thing.* I hope you'll have as much fun reading my posts as I have writing them.
