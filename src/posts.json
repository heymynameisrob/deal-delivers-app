    "content": "Discover the fascinating back story of the local people who make Deal such a fabulous place to live and work. Get a unique inside track into the best places to eat and drink in the area, and who knows? You may pick up some hidden gems to try**.** \n\nMeet Sharon Cullen, the owner of Wellingtons Bistro and Bar on Beach Street which was launched on Valentine’s Day 2019. \n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dealdelivers/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_80,w_500/v1603749712/image_s1rjmf.png)\n\nI was born locally in Kingsdown and still live in central Deal in the heart of town. I have three children: my eldest is 23 and works at Wellies while she is finishing her final year at university. In fact, she is running our newest initiative, the meatballs side of the business. My middle child lives in Birmingham after graduating and my youngest is a horse-mad 10-year old.\n\nI initially worked in marketing and as sales manager for a large food retailer before returning to education in my 40’s to study for a degree and masters in sociology and social policy at the University of Kent. I was about to start my PhD when my mum became ill with lung cancer. I stopped my studies to spend the last few months with her while she slowly passed away over the following year. Mum’s impending death made me take a long hard look at my life and ask: ‘Was I happy?’ Would my anger at politics actually be enough to allow me to make the changes in children’s social mobility and access to quality education I had written my dissertation on? I was married to a chef and was reflecting on how much we had both loved running our own catering business in the past, when the opportunity to buy Wellingtons came up. I remembered how in the early days of our marriage we used to play ‘ready steady cook’ at home! We both loved cooking, watching cookery programmes for ideas and generally got excited about food.\n\nAlthough I was divorced by then, my former husband was very supportive and helped me start making changes to elevate the original café image as a bit of a ‘greasy spoon’, to create the kind of place I knew Wellington’s could be. In the first few months, I got an alcohol license and spent six whole months - I kid you not - finding the perfect sausage! After all, I would have been foolish not to continue building on the wonderful reputation Wellington’s already had as a go-to breakfast café. So I focused on ensuring that - working in partnership with Rook’s Butchers and other suppliers, every item on our breakfast menu was of premium local ingredients. Me and the team had just got through our first year, introducing innovations like our popular tapas nights, when Covid hit. I brought the idea for a menu of Tapas Towers back from the time I spent in the Canaries, but with a 10pm curfew, we will be looking at our evening opening again and watching happy diners munching our tapas, burgers and wraps in Spring 21.\n\nOur ethos - particularly on good value - has very much been to look after locals first. I am most proud of growing our reputation for how wonderful the staff here are: incredibly attentive and polite. I truly believe in love and respect for both front of house and kitchen team. I earned my way through studying in later life by waitressing in restaurants and bars and have never forgotten the disgusting way I heard some chefs speaking to serving staff. I used to find myself thinking (prophetically?): ‘when I have own restaurant, I certainly won’t be doing it like this!’ At Wellington’s, all our team have each other’s back, a supportive vibe which reflects to our diners. Happy staff very definitely equal happy customers here. Meatballs are the latest innovation we have brought to Deal Delivers. Available Thursday to Monday to takeaway or be delivered to your door, customers can revel in delicate chicken and basil meatballs, gorgeous chili pork and sublime rustic beef. I know a recipe is working when I can’t stop eating! I got the idea when I saw a New York restaurant’s meatballs and as a working single parent, thought what a fantastic concept which would work as a healthy choice takeaway. We add our deliciously special salad with tenderstem broccoli and chargrilled peppers: it’s home cooking delivered to door.\n\nWe are amazed how well the meatball delivery service has gone, to be honest, and been touched by so much lovely feedback. 36 customers downloaded our Meatball Co app and ordered on the first day, which was fantastic, until we realised the app wasn’t regulating orders and kitchen was initially becoming overwhelmed by the positive response. It’s sorted now thankfully, and we are also delivering cocktails, our fruit shake ultimate milk shake or a freshly poured pint right to your door!\n\n**Are you a cook?**\n\nNot exactly, but I certainly enjoy having a go and I love to eat!\n\n**Any cooking tips?**\n\nKeep it simple - the best dishes are often the simplest (like our meatballs!). Oh, and to get great pork crackling, pour boiling water on the skin before you salt it.\n\n**What’s your favourite dish?**\n\nThis is hard to say because I have eclectic tastes, but I’m truffle mad! I’ve been known to sneak truffle oil into my handbag when eating out with my family. They laughed when I put truffle mash on my takeaway menu, but it’s been really popular- along with our truffle fries and skin on fries. When I launch our spring burger menu, I'll have to include a Truffle burger! \n\n**And a drink to go with it?**\n\nWine thanks: Sancerre if I’m feeling flush or a New Zealand sauvignon. My very favourite red is a Valopolicello Rapasso from the wine merchants on The Strand in Walmer: The Strand Wine Co.\n\n**What's your favourite restaurant in the Deal area?**\n\nHas to be The Courtyard, Sondes Road in Deal. I love the décor, the food, the service, none of which is pretentious. I like to mix up my menu choices, but I recently had a pork loin with cracking stick which was absolutely yummy. I’m kind of torn, so I’d like to give a huge shout-out to Victuals in St George’s Passage, too. I love everything they have done. It’s a wonderfully intimate place to eat with exceptional food.\n\n**And pub?**\n\nI’ll start at Bloody Mary’s on High Street, then move on to the Gaiety Bar or Bohemian where I admit to enjoying holing up in their intimate interior with a good friend and a bottle of vino. And for a different vibe and décor I might end up in the King’s Head!\n\n**Who's your favourite TV cook?**\n\nGotta be Rick Stein: I love following his travels through the Med and Mexico. I find it so interesting when he talks about culture and gets to know the locals and what they are cooking…\n\n**You can find Wellingtons Bistro & Bar at 27 Beach Street**\n\n**Open 9am - 2pm Monday to Friday through winter and weekends 9am - 3pm  [www.wellingtonsdeal.co.uk](https://www.wellingtonsdeal.co.uk/)**\n\n**Download the app for a Meatball delivery [www.themeatballcompany.co.uk](https://eur06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.themeatballcompany.co.uk%2F&data=04%7C01%7C%7C8f366f69358b47a54c8608d874309063%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637387099207124775%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=RFhE41qWE%2Fi7UIwIlaSEvmgG3IeSgljgX6xFB6obEEc%3D&reserved=0)**"

    "content": "The first in our weekly series is talented therapist Sarah Jane McGahan at ***[Daisy Green The Holistic Shed](https://www.facebook.com/sarahmcgahan.daisygreen)*,** a rather unique spa run from a peaceful shed in Sarah’s back garden. Sarah’s pampering products and home ‘treat’ment kits helped kept us sane(ish!) during lockdown and she has rave 5* reviews on Facebook.\n\n![deal delivers daisy green holistic shed](https://res.cloudinary.com/dealdelivers/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,q_80,w_500/v1603292558/IMG_1498_vn19fy.jpg)\n\nSarah is a holistic therapist, born and bred in Deal. She is married with two children, one aged 22 living independently and a 17 year old still at home busy studying for A levels - oh, and tortoise Terence Trent (after singer D’Arby, cross our hearts).\n\n> I have always loved beauty products and when I first went for a spa day I decided it was the career for me! When my son was two, I enrolled in adult education and qualified as a beauty therapist and compelted a holistc massage course followed by various jobs in spas and salons including spa manager for a leading skincare bran. I took the plunge to set up on my own three years ago. I invested in a rather wonderful shed in my garden, my natural skincare studio, where I like to treat people’s skin beautifully, help their aches and pains, give my clients a moment in their packed lives for some hard-earned ‘me-time’ to think about nothing and even nap away from their kids and job. In the sanctuary of the shed, I offer bespoke holistic facials, hot stone massage, head massage, body scrubs, waxing, manicures, pedicures and pregnancy treatments. I love talking to people to really get what makes them tick, what they need so I can best help them. I also offer a bespoke organic product range from Surrey starting at £15 and make my own lavender body scrubs. Our pamper baskets from £20 are ready for gifting anytime, especially at Christmas and individual products will be ethically wrapped in scarves made out of recycled saris I select from another local independent.\n>\n> During lockdown, I had to shut my spa business which was utterly heart-breaking. I’m not afraid to say I’m an emotional person, so many tears were shed. My pampering products were all sitting in the spa, so I decided to make up face and body pamper packs and deliver them to my customers at home… literally on my bike!\n>\n> I contacted all my customers to tell them I had to close and offering them our product packs. I was so relieved when they loved the idea: deliveries kept my mind and brain ticking over, my body out in the fresh air with spa deliveries in my ‘granny-style’ bike basket! Most of my orders came via the Deal Delivers facebook page, which accounted for about 60% of the business - a total lifeline for me to pay the bills. People wanted to treat themselves, and get back to a bit of normality when times were anything but normal. Treat night in like mum and daughter pedis were particularly popular.\n>\n> Now government guidelines have changed, thankfully I am back open. Our ‘one in one out’ is easier to control in my shed spa than a salon. Deliveries have reduced but we are making up special Christmas hampers and seeing gift vouchers rising as more people have heard about us and Christmas creeps up!\n\n### **Favourite Things**\n\n#### 1. The beach\n\nI know it’s a bit of a cliché, but the beach is where I’m happy and is at the centre of many of my fond memories growing up here in Deal. A walk along the sea front is where I go for time to myself, to get some fresh air and clear my thoughts, although I have never seen the beach so busy as this year! I always notice if you are in the car coming from London, as you get towards Dover the air quality changes. I like to go early, about 6am and usually stroll between Deal and Sandown Castle. Some days the sea is tranquil, other days its crazy and I often see the ‘Deal seal’. Can anyone tell me if there’s more than one?\n\n#### 2. Deal People\n\nThere is so much community spirit here in Deal, in a crisis like we have just had, it is heartening to see everyone rallying together to help each other out and get through together. Deal has history, charm, character and smiley people- no wonder we are becoming ever more popular.\n\n#### 3. Kingsdown Woods\n\nWith the seafront one side, in just a couple of minutes’ walk you can be in the woods, through the fields or along the cliffs exploring all the wonderful nature of the area, butterflies, bees, flowers… I particularly love seeing and smelling the carpet of bluebells in Kingsdown Woods in the spring and snowdrops in the winter.\n\n#### 4. St Margaret’s and Sandwich Bays\n\nA walk along the cliffs to the cosy beach at St Margaret’s is lovely, with a bonus it’s not so well known, so less busy or crowded. You can have a well-earned drink at **[The Coastguard](https://thecoastguard.co.uk/)** and I sometimes walk on to Dover. Sandwich Bay is beautiful, we sometimes take our campervan during the day and make our lunch in our little kitchen, maybe a nice chicken salad with meat, breads and dips from **[Deal’s wonderful Saturday market](https://www.facebook.com/DealTownMarket)**. I particularly appreciate the greengrocers and good quality meat from the butcher there. I’d also recommend a day trip to Rye, especially the nature reserve where we saw a family of seals recently.\n\n#### 5. Top restaurants\n\n**[The Thai Restaurant](https://www.bangkokpavilion.co.uk/)** on High Street and [Beach Street Table 81](https://81beachstreet.co.uk/) are our favourites so far. Located opposite The Royal Hotel, I think 81’s burgers and sea bass are particularly good, really lovely food. Two years ago, I travelled Thailand for four weeks and fell in love with the spiciness of Thai food. A Pad Thai or Red Thai curry with Udon noodles on the High Street brings those magical memories back…\n\n#### \\\n6. Urban Chic\n\nThe owners at [Urban Chic](http://www.urbanchicltd.co.uk/), Claire and Dawn are so friendly. I love their clothes, my most recent purchase being a T Shirt and I can always find little gifts for people.\n\n#### \\\n7. Local Food\n\n[Jill Martin of Town Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/jill.martin.1460) has a stall at the Saturday Market where I am always tempted by her delicious sausage rolls and curries. I was also introduced to the scrummy [Hotsie Totsie cakes](https://www.facebook.com/hotsytotsycb) and bakes by Jill’s daughter Jessica Martin through the Deal Delivers page and have become a regular customer. Can I recommend her gin and tonic cake? Mmmm. I went to a ‘Ladies at Lunch’ event recently where Jill was the guest speaker and her daughter Jessica made the delicious dessert. To attend the event advertised online, you have to get in quick for the few spaces round Jill’s kitchen table… which is also in her garden shed. There’s clearly a theme!\n\n##### You can book spa treatments, vouchers or products with Sarah on [Daisy45green at gmail dot com](mailto:Daisy45green@gmail.com) or call 07504 023086"
