Trick or Treating might not be the done thing this year... but with Halloween being a big deal in the kiddy calendar it's even more important to make an effort this year and have a bit of fun - if that's still allowed ;)

**1. Sweeten things up** 

Sweets delivered became a big thing over lockdown. Lollipop Ladies were dropping off gift boxes to chirp up families, movie nights to alternative birthday cakes. Their nostalgic Halloween selection makes the perfect selection for 'Going Ghosting' - this is when you leave suprise treats on friends doorsteps. Altogether now..'Ahhhhhhhh' - . Find them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lollipopladieshire)

**2. Enjoy a Halloween Fiesta**\
\
Salentino's are going all out to make sure Halloween doesn't get forgotten this year. Mocktails, pumpkin carving at your table and a goody bag to take home. Billed (by Salentinos) as 'the ulitmate trick or treating house', sounds pretty good to us! [Find out more >>](https://www.salentinos.com/halloween-2020)

**3. Buy Decorations for Life**\
\
If, like us, you think decorations are for life not just for Halloween... Emily Stone sculpts animals from copper, and her bats and spiders have the most wonderful detail, you'll find them impossible to put away. Discover artist [Emily Stone](https://www.coppercreatures.co.uk/) >>

**4. Halloween Geocashing**\
\
They've done it again... Betteshanger saves Halloween with pumpkin carving, Halloween Geocashing and a spooky Halloween trail (can we join in please?!).  You could become a member and support all their brilliant activities. [Betteshanger this way >](https://www.betteshanger-park.co.uk/)

**5.Watch a Scary Movie**

Hop in your car and head to the Canterbury Drive-in cinema to see [The Exorcist](https://thelittleboxoffice.com/kentdriveincinema/event/view/130907) (not for the faint hearted) on October 31st.  Ditch the popcorn - we recommend getting one of Mary's delcious [Seagraze](https://www.seagraze.co.uk/) boxes.  These new grazing boxes are packed with the finest meats and cheeses. Get one delivered before you go for a movie night to remember.
