#### Unique, locally handcrafted, artisan Christmas gifts delivered to your door to solve present problems galore? Yes please we say!

*Deal Delivers’ roving reporter Faye meets your chief present problem solver, Jo Holmes of The Village artisan market in Sondes Road, opposite The Courtyard bar restaurant.*

Like all non-essential retailers, The Village had to close on 5 November for the second lockdown during the prime Christmas shopping period. Jo who has the Take a Seat upholstery stall in the Village was determined to support her fellow stallholders by bringing their collective offerings to a social media screen near you!

#### Who's in The Village?

“The Village, a kind of craft traders collective, was the idea of [Neil from Walk Don’t Walk Gallery](https://www.dontwalkwalkgallery.com/) and Vince from [The Courtyard bar restaurant](https://www.thecourtyarddeal.co.uk/). We have been going for 18 months now with a wide range of self-employed local independent traders and craftspeople bringing their wares to the lovely people of Deal and town visitors. On a normal market day, you would find gifts galore and masses of unique items to decorate your home from linocut prints by [Jenny Preston](https://www.instagram.com/jennyprestonart/) to [Fiona Bradshaw’s lamps ](https://www.instagram.com/fionabradshawdesigns/)created from salvaged objects. [Barrels and Bespoak](https://www.instagram.com/barrelsandbespoak/) make rustic oak creations from old whiskey barrels for personalised interior and exterior furnishings and my own business- [Take A Seat](https://www.instagram.com/takeaseatupholstery/)- where people love my funky cushions and weekly chair clinic. Aside from larger commissions, I take in small ‘poorly’ chairs for same day turnround. Whether you are a local wanting some beautiful fabric for your dining chairs, a student doing your homework on grandad’s precious old tattered chair or a holiday home owner needing a stained chair recovering, I can help.

The Village is also home to the likes of Mrs McKenzie’s award winning marmalades, jams and chutneys, [PedaalDuwer’s](https://www.instagram.com/pedaalduwer/) vintage bike auction sales and hire, [LJ Artisan](https://www.instagram.com/ljartisan/), the Celtic jeweller (otherwise known as the wire maiden!) and [Hella Bella vintage clothing](https://www.instagram.com/hella_bella_thrifting/).

During the first lockdown, a lot of our Village stall holders joined Deal Delivers. It made a big difference, not just to local people who wanted to access our products, but to us as self-employed stall holders for whom selling our wares at The Village was our main source of income. When we lost face to face contact with our customers, we could have lost our businesses. Plus in a double blow, many of us took that leap of faith to go it alone when The Village opened back in April 2019, so we were excluded from the government self-employment grant and local authority business grants and had to rely on Universal Credit.

Some of us had businesses already, trekking round loads of different craft fairs, but with no point of sale. And our own Deal market proved impossible to get into because it was so successful, stall space was limited.

Originally The Village was a warehouse for Courts Furniture Shop, then an antiques warehouse, dark and gloomy. It was transformed by a lick of paint and Vince and Neil’s vision to create and extend an artisan hub around South Street and Sondes Road, giving local makers the undercover opportunity of an indoor market. People say The Village has all the hustle of a market with a laid-back vibe and very warm welcome. Stallholders are so open and chatty, we have customers who make a point of coming in every week for particular gifts or to get help creating unique interiors for their individual homes.

People are still learning about The Village, mainly online and in the press, but we do have our A-boards on the pavements. Us traders are a local lot who love to support charities like the RNLI with prizes for their Christmas raffle last year, and for The Astor Theatre raffle. PedaalDuwer has also been actively supporting and leading community initiatives for meetups, friendship and support and of course, bike rides!

In the last lockdown, a few of us worked with [Love Local](https://www.facebook.com/lovelocaldeal1) and found the [Deal Delivers Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/dealdelivers) a god-send with its free access and ability to post your own updates.

> ##### Now the more tech-savvy amongst us have set up [The Village Market Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thevillagecommunitymarket/) and [Facebook feeds](https://www.facebook.com/thevillagecommunitymarket), where we are offering all our wonderful local products for sale with FREE doorstep delivery to Deal and the surrounding areas.

For me, being on Deal Delivers has been fantastic. The page has offered a single point of access enabling local people to easily go to one place and know they are supporting local businesses. Deal Delivers has a much wider audience than The Village has. People get fed up of adverts streaming at them from multiple channels, but if they have a single channel, people will take time to consider what they want and enjoy an easy way to get those things.

We know this new lockdown is taking us into the critical Christmas shopping period, but The Village stallholders are all still desperately hoping we get to join the **Deal Late Night shopping event currently scheduled for Friday 4 December**. All our individual stall holders will be posting on our site and Deal Delivers to share ideas for Christmas gifts - unknown territory for many. I count myself lucky I have work booked in until January that I can deliver from my country workshop and can still go out to quote. All stallholders have different pressures but are working together to offer people a way to access goods and gifts in as safe a way as possible in the coming months. We have done a lot of work to make the market Covid compliant and customer numbers grew as confidence grew. We really benefited from day trippers, weekenders and those on staycations; the town has been buzzing for the last couple of months and we want to continue to give people options for individual and personalised gifts you can’t buy on Amazon, made by real people locally.”

#### **Meet Jo**

Jo describes herself as a BFL - Back From Londoner! She worked in the public sector, predominantly as commissioner in the NHS, then headed innovation for Age UK National before redundancy saw her head back to Deal and spend the summer questioning what she wanted to do next, having given 35 years in public service. It was Jo’s aunt who inspired her to consider upholstery. “I bought a couple of chairs- I’ve always been a bit of magpie- and went to upholstery classes, initially locally, then at Faversham Upholstery School. Starting a stall at The Village market seemed a bit early, but I felt I had to jump in at the deep end and it’s gone really well.

I also started selling Fusion mineral paint last year. In the last lockdown, fusion mineral paint was in such huge demand as people turned to upcycling home projects they had never got round to, that supplies ran out across the country, so my doorstep delivery was warmly welcomed by many! This lockdown we face a national foam shortage, because foam is a by-product from fuel. As fuel consumption has decreased, those by-products are not available to manufacturers, so prices have increased 20%. Fortunately, I also use a rubberised coir - mix coconut fibre or the traditional horsehair upholstery which has been around since 1920s. It lasts much longer than foam and is a much more eco-friendly product.
