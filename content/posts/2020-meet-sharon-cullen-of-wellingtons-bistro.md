I was born locally in Kingsdown and still live in central Deal in the heart of town. I have three children: my eldest is 23 and works at Wellies while she is finishing her final year at university. In fact, she is running our newest initiative, the meatballs side of the business. My middle child lives in Birmingham after graduating and my youngest is a horse-mad 10-year old.

I initially worked in marketing and as sales manager for a large food retailer before returning to education in my 40’s to study for a degree and masters in sociology and social policy at the University of Kent. I was about to start my PhD when my mum became ill with lung cancer. I stopped my studies to spend the last few months with her while she slowly passed away over the following year. Mum’s impending death made me take a long hard look at my life and ask: ‘Was I happy?’ Would my anger at politics actually be enough to allow me to make the changes in children’s social mobility and access to quality education I had written my dissertation on? I was married to a chef and was reflecting on how much we had both loved running our own catering business in the past, when the opportunity to buy Wellingtons came up. I remembered how in the early days of our marriage we used to play ‘ready steady cook’ at home! We both loved cooking, watching cookery programmes for ideas and generally got excited about food.

Although I was divorced by then, my former husband was very supportive and helped me start making changes to elevate the original café image as a bit of a ‘greasy spoon’, to create the kind of place I knew Wellington’s could be. In the first few months, I got an alcohol license and spent six whole months - I kid you not - finding the perfect sausage! After all, I would have been foolish not to continue building on the wonderful reputation Wellington’s already had as a go-to breakfast café. So I focused on ensuring that - working in partnership with Rook’s Butchers and other suppliers, every item on our breakfast menu was of premium local ingredients. Me and the team had just got through our first year, introducing innovations like our popular tapas nights, when Covid hit. I brought the idea for a menu of Tapas Towers back from the time I spent in the Canaries, but with a 10pm curfew, we will be looking at our evening opening again and watching happy diners munching our tapas, burgers and wraps in Spring 21.

Our ethos - particularly on good value - has very much been to look after locals first. I am most proud of growing our reputation for how wonderful the staff here are: incredibly attentive and polite. I truly believe in love and respect for both front of house and kitchen team. I earned my way through studying in later life by waitressing in restaurants and bars and have never forgotten the disgusting way I heard some chefs speaking to serving staff. I used to find myself thinking (prophetically?): ‘when I have own restaurant, I certainly won’t be doing it like this!’ At Wellington’s, all our team have each other’s back, a supportive vibe which reflects to our diners. Happy staff very definitely equal happy customers here. Meatballs are the latest innovation we have brought to Deal Delivers. Available Thursday to Monday to takeaway or be delivered to your door, customers can revel in delicate chicken and basil meatballs, gorgeous chili pork and sublime rustic beef. I know a recipe is working when I can’t stop eating! I got the idea when I saw a New York restaurant’s meatballs and as a working single parent, thought what a fantastic concept which would work as a healthy choice takeaway. We add our deliciously special salad with tenderstem broccoli and chargrilled peppers: it’s home cooking delivered to door.

We are amazed how well the meatball delivery service has gone, to be honest, and been touched by so much lovely feedback. 36 customers downloaded our Meatball Co app and ordered on the first day, which was fantastic, until we realised the app wasn’t regulating orders and kitchen was initially becoming overwhelmed by the positive response. It’s sorted now thankfully, and we are also delivering cocktails, our fruit shake ultimate milk shake or a freshly poured pint right to your door!

**Are you a cook?**

Not exactly, but I certainly enjoy having a go and I love to eat!

**Any cooking tips?**

Keep it simple - the best dishes are often the simplest (like our meatballs!). Oh, and to get great pork crackling, pour boiling water on the skin before you salt it.

**What’s your favourite dish?**

This is hard to say because I have eclectic tastes, but I’m truffle mad! I’ve been known to sneak truffle oil into my handbag when eating out with my family. They laughed when I put truffle mash on my takeaway menu, but it’s been really popular- along with our truffle fries and skin on fries. When I launch our spring burger menu, I'll have to include a Truffle burger! 

**And a drink to go with it?**

Wine thanks: Sancerre if I’m feeling flush or a New Zealand sauvignon. My very favourite red is a Valopolicello Rapasso from the wine merchants on The Strand in Walmer: The Strand Wine Co.

**What's your favourite restaurant in the Deal area?**

Has to be The Courtyard, Sondes Road in Deal. I love the décor, the food, the service, none of which is pretentious. I like to mix up my menu choices, but I recently had a pork loin with cracking stick which was absolutely yummy. I’m kind of torn, so I’d like to give a huge shout-out to Victuals in St George’s Passage, too. I love everything they have done. It’s a wonderfully intimate place to eat with exceptional food.

**And pub?**

I’ll start at Bloody Mary’s on High Street, then move on to the Gaiety Bar or Bohemian where I admit to enjoying holing up in their intimate interior with a good friend and a bottle of vino. And for a different vibe and décor I might end up in the King’s Head!

**Who's your favourite TV cook?**

Gotta be Rick Stein: I love following his travels through the Med and Mexico. I find it so interesting when he talks about culture and gets to know the locals and what they are cooking…
