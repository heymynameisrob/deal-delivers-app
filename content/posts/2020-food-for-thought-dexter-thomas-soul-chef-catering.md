I was born in Jamaica, the middle child of five, spending my childhood either playing or in the kitchen since I was 9. At 17, I left the Caribbean to come to London with my elder brother to live with my dad and study catering at Lewisham college for 3 years. I always knew becoming a chef was the only thing I wanted to do. After work experience as an apprentice chef in a hotel, my career included the Crown Plaza, Savoy, and working for Jamie Oliver. When I met my wife, who works front-of-house in restaurants, 8 years ago, she wanted a change from London so we moved to Deal to be near her family. I was initially against the idea, especially as my first visit was on a rainy, miserable weekend in November! But I gave Deal a try and have ended up loving the place! Simon who owns [Rees and Rees jewellery](https://www.reesandreesjewellery.co.uk/) on High Street kindly provided a place to stay while we looked for somewhere of our own. Meantime, I was away a lot freelancing around the UK and Europe from Wales to Norway. It’s a good job my wife understands the industry! Lockdown stopped me travelling. I started cooking from home initially, providing food for those who couldn’t go out, while my wife was cycling around delivering meals. I was making such a mess in our kitchen, my wife said, "I’m not doing this no more!"

The owner of Little Green Shop recommended I talk to James at [the Astor](https://theastor.co.uk/) about using his kitchen, but literally the day we met, the national lockdown was announced. When we opened, we got the word out about Soul Food through Deal Delivers, being one of the first few on their Facebook page. We’d leave our business cards in the delivery bags and our reputation spread: people were telling their neighbours and friends how much they enjoyed this new Soul Chef food and the business took off.

The business grew so much, we have created two additional jobs: our driver who delivers our famous jerk food Friday to Sunday and my 16 year old weekend kitchen assistant.

I started with home-cooked meals like mushroom spaghetti or stir-fried chicken fusion, but it wasn’t Caribbean SOUL food!

My mum always said do what you are used to, what makes your heart sing and you’re good at. So since lockdown eased, I started with one BBQ drum serving jerk pork for a fiver a box, and have bought two more since, to keep up with demand. I had more ideas and the Deal community were giving me feedback on the phone and reviews on Facebook asking for more.

Now I look after veggies, vegans and coeliacs with their own separate BBQ drum. People often don’t realise 90% of traditional Jamaican food is plant based like yam, corn and banana, because meat is so expensive for islanders.

What I love about Deal is how close-knit this community is and how they love and support local independents. I’ve never experienced this kind of thing anywhere else. That’s why the meat we buy is from Goodchild’s butchers in Walmer, our fish from [Jenkins](https://jenkinsandsonfishandgame.co.uk/free-home-delivery/) and our fruit and veg from [Bartlett and White](https://www.facebook.com/bartlettandwhite/).

Watch this space, because we are looking at opening a small seating Jamaican themed restaurant in The Astor.

**Are you a cook?**

No- I’m a chef who loves cooking! Every dish I put on a plate has soul and love in it; if I’m not happy with it, it won’t leave my kitchen. Everything we do in Soul Chef is done out of passion.

**Any cooking tips?**

If you’re going to do a dinner, don’t rush it: whatever you put in, you’ll get out. And don’t be afraid of experimenting- you’ve got to believe in yourself in the kitchen.

**What’s your favourite dish?**

It’s not even Jamaican, but currently I am in love with jerk venison loin with a juniper berry jus, dauphinoise potato and tender stem broccoli. It’s going to be on our winter menu.

**And a drink to go with it?**

A nice bottle of red. Or a rum punch we can deliver along with our food if I’m feeling more Jamaican! I sent my friend Karl from [Cocktails in a Bottle](https://cocktailinabottle.co.uk/) the recipe for my rum punch and he has created his own version: delicious!

**Your favourite restaurant in the Deal area?**

Easily [The Lane’s burgers](https://www.thelanedeal.co.uk/) which are amazing.

I can recommend my favourite chicken burger. The chicken is friend in buttermilk, served with lettuce, pickles and their own tomato sauce. Warning - they are so big, you certainly don’t feel hungry for a long time after!

**And pub?**

I can see [The Bohemian](http://www.thebohemian.co.uk/) from my lounge window and love sitting outside in their gardens with a nice pint of Blonde Whitstable Bay ale.

**What’s the worst meal you’ve ever had?**

I had a terrible Indian curry a while ago I can still taste, just recalling it.  Say no more.

**And the best?**

In Thailand travelling on holiday with my wife. I like spice, I was raised on spice all my life, so a stand-out meal was fried fish coated in lime, chilli, lemongrass in a soup, those flavours were all so amazing together.

**Your favourite TV cook?**

Without a doubt, Gordon Ramsay. He’s real and even if you don’t like what he says, he says it anyway. In any kitchen, you need to be able to stand your ground and say it how it is.

**What do you think of Deal as a place to eat out?**

I absolutely *love* Deal! Even if you are not from around here, perhaps just down for the day, there is so much choice of places to eat… even since I moved down 18 months ago, we are seeing so much more interest in food, like the new Turkish place opening alongside a more traditional style of cooking and restaurants which are still producing *really* good food.
