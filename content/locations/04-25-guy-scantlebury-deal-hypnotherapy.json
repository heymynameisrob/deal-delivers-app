  "description": "The key to any wellbeing, both mental and physical, is a sense of being in the present.  We all spend a lot of time, though, dwelling on the past and planning for things that are in the future.  I work with clients to help them with the thoughts and emotions that tie them to this thinking. To become their own inner problem solver and enjoy their lives in the moment. Visit my website for free material to help deal with COVID anxiety."
