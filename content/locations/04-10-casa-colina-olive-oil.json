  "description": "At Casa Colina we produce small batches of our own delicious olive oil from our 200 ancient olives trees on our finca Spain. It is organic, cold pressed and unfiltered. The resulting oil is extra virgin with a low acidity of 0.4%. It is soft and buttery in flavour and perfect for cooking and drizzling. We can deliver it bottled to your door step."
