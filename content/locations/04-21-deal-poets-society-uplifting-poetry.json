  "description": "A group of Deal writers have created an anthology of their poetry on Love, Life, Loss.  The book was launched at the Lighthouse in Walmer back in February (pre Lockdown!) to a full house. Plans for further live events including an appearance at the Sandwich Folk and Ale Festival sadly have been postponed.  We have covered all printing costs between us and have decided to donate all proceeds from sale of this volume to Pilgrims Hospices.  Cover Price Â£5.99 but donations of any amount welcomed at this difficult time. See our JustGiving page or to order a copy please email or text"
