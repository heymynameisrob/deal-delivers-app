  "description": "All the Deal Area Foodbank distribution centres are closed until further notice and all food distribution will be by home delivery.  If you are in quarantine or self-isolation and have no one to shop for you and need food to be delivered to you. Deliveries will normally be on the following weekday and the most vulnerable will be prioritised. Also looking for donations.  "
