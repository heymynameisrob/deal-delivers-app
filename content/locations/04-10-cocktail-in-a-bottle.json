  "description": "My hand-crafted pre-made bottled cocktails are made 'fresh to order' by blending premium selected quality spirits (Many of which are Kentish) with natural ingredients in order to create something that is truly authentic and delicious. With over 20 vintage, classic and contemporary 'bar quality' cocktails on my menu, I have something for everyone to get the party started! "
